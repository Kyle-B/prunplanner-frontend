			Core Concepts
		</h1>
		<p class="text-white/60 text-center text-xl mb-10">
			PRUNplanner consists of three main components that allow you to plan
			and manage your Prosperous Universe empire.
		</p>
		<div
			class="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 divide-x divide-white/20 child:p-10 mb-10">
			<div>
				<div class="text-white text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Plans</div>
				<div class="text-lg font-mono text-white/60">
					Plans are the backbone of what you do in PRUNplanner. They
					consist of all buildings, productions and bonuses of a base
					you can put down in Prosperous Universe. You can create new
					plans by searching for the planet you would like to create a
					base for. Also, a plan should be assigned a CX Exchange
					preference, as well as be assigned to an Empire.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<div class="text-white text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Empires</div>
				<div class="text-lg font-mono text-white/60">
					An Empire is a collection of plans (e.g. all the bases you
					currently have settled in Prosperous Universe, or that you
					would like to settle, all interconnected together). Each
					empire is like a container that consists of multiple plans.
					Additionally, an exchange preference can be assigned to each
					Empire.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="">
				<div class="text-white text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Exchanges</div>
				<div class="text-lg font-mono text-white/60">
					The Exchange Settings allow you to define market preferences
					for the pricing of materials. Each preference can be used in
					multiple Empires. However, each Empire can only have a
					single Exchange preference assigned to it. This ensures that
					prices are properly calculated for all individual plans that
					are part of the Empire.
