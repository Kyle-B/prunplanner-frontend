/**
 * # Precomputed References
 *
 * This composable leverages Vue 3's reactivity system to pre-compute certain data
 * that remains static during various user planning actions.
 * For an in-depth understanding of Vue's reactivity, refer to the official
 * documentation: https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth.
 *
 * The primary goal is to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary
 * recalculations of data that do not change frequently. For example, building
 * data and their associated recipe options are pre-computed because they only
 * change when a building is removed or replaced. These options remain
 * unaffected by changes to active recipes or their quantities made by the user.
 *
 * By pre-computing and caching this data, we ensure that the application
 * remains responsive and efficient, even as users make frequent adjustments
 * to their plans.
