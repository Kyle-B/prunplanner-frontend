The Production Chains view lets you explore all the buildings and materials involved in producing a specific good. You can follow the entire chain step by step to see exactly how your chosen product is created.

To make analysis easier, you can color nodes by material category, workforce type, or required building expertise. If a chain offers multiple recipe options, you can fine-tune your selection until youâ€™ve built the chain that best fits your needs.

The tool also provides an overview of all building expertises and workforce types required across the entire chain, giving you a clear picture of what it takes to complete production.
