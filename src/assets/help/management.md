# Core Concepts

PRUNplanner consists of three main components that allow you to plan and manage your Prosperous Universe empire:

## Plans

Plans are the backbone of what you do in PRUNplanner. They consist of all buildings, productions and bonuses of a base you can put down in Prosperous Universe. You can create new Plans by searching for the planet you would like to create a base for. Also, a Plan should be assigned a CX Exchange preference, as well as to an Empire. Please note, each Plan can be assigned to multiple empires and therefore reused.

## Empires

An Empire is a collection of Plans (e.g. all the bases you currently have settled in Prosperous Universe, or that you would like to settle, all interconnected together). Each empire is like a container that consists of multiple plans. Additionally, a single CX Exchange preference can be assigned to each Empire.

## CX

The CX Settings allow you to define market preferences for the pricing of materials. Each CX Exchange can be used in multiple Empires. However, each Empire can only have a single CX Exchange preference assigned to it. This ensures that prices are properly calculated for individual plans that are part of the Empire.
