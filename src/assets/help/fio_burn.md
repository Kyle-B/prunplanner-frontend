# Calculations

Plan calculations are based on the production and storage data of your plans. To get accurate results, youâ€™ll need to have your data synced via FIO. Please note that degradation is not included in these calculations.

# Thresholds

PRUNplanner uses color thresholds to highlight important values:

- Yellow indicates that a value is approaching a limit or may need attention soon.
- Red means the threshold has been exceeded and requires immediate attention.

These thresholds help you quickly spot potential issues in your production or storage before they become critical.
