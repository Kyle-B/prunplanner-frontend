The **Empire view** gives you a complete overview of your plans and their combined production within an empire. Here, you can also adjust your faction and permits, since both affect your production bonuses. Plans can be assigned to an empire in the **Management view**.

In addition to tracking production, the empire automatically calculates your **daily profit, costs** (including materials, workforce, and degradation), and total **revenue** based on your personal exchange preferences. These figures aren’t just a simple sum of your plans—they use weighted prices that take both production and consumption into account across the entire empire.

The **Empire Material I/O** view shows how much of each material your empire produces and where. You can filter consumables in or out, or focus purely on load balancing, comparing production and consumption at a glance.

Finally, the **Empire Analysis** provides charts that break down your profits by plans and materials. You can also explore what your empire net produces or consumes, as well as which materials are produced or consumed exclusively.
