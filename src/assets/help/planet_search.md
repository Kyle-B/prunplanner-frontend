The **Planet Search** lets you quickly find planets by name or ID, or use the Advanced Search to narrow results with multiple parameters.

With Advanced Search, you can look for up to four specific materials, filter by COGC programs, or select planets with certain features such as fertility or a warehouse. You can also search by distance from a chosen system or by environment parameters like surface type, gravity, temperature, or pressure.

Planet Search is also the starting point for creating a new plan: simply find the planet youâ€™re interested in and begin your plan from there.
