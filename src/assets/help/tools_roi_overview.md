The ROI Overview tool is a collaborative creation, developed with insights from Lowstrife, MemoryAlpha, and Laaxus in the PCT and Prosperous Universe Discord communities.

It uses a linear model to calculate the optimal number of production buildings and the required habitation buildings to maximize the use of a 500-area base, factoring in workforce requirements, STO for large or heavy materials, and alignment with 5 experts and COGC. The calculations assume normal planetary conditions—standard surface, temperature, pressure, and gravity—for all available building recipes.

Buildings such as EXT, RIG, COL, and FRM are excluded, as their outputs depend on a planet's unique resources and fertility. Additionally, the tool considers your CX preferences.
