The ROI Overview tool is a collaborative creation, developed with insights from Lowstrife, MemoryAlpha, and Laaxus in the PCT and Prosperous Universe Discord communities. The purpose of these ROI tools is to normalize the profitability of all buildings in the game to the profit per unit of area, as that is the only common shared metric. This is extrapolated out to "profit per 500 area" assuming a full base of these buildings. This allows one to compare the profitability of building A to building B purely on the merits of their recipes. 

This tool uses a linear model to calculate the optimal number of production buildings and the required habitation buildings to maximize the use of a 500-area base, factoring in workforce requirements, STO for large or heavy materials, and alignment with 5 experts and COGC. The calculations assume normal planetary conditions—standard surface, temperature, pressure, and gravity—for all available building recipes. The tool will also consider your CX preferences.

Buildings such as EXT, RIG, COL, and FRM are excluded, as their outputs depend on a planet's unique resources and fertility. Figures for these excluded buildings can be viewed on the Resource ROI Overview.
