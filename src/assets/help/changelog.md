# 2025-08-29

- Improve HQ upgrade calculator by using using a regular computed expression.
- Adjust paddings and spacing on Plan view and Navigation

# 2025-08-28

- Introduces first parts and core logic to have PRUNplanner use IndexedDB instead of localStorage to persist data. This firstly only involves storing Planets and Materials. You'll notice that some behaviour is different as calculation work will be done asynchronously as well. The goal is to fully replace Pinia for storing Game Data soon and building the foundation for cross-tab syncing via Broadcasts eventually. Learn more about it in the [PR-210](https://github.com/PRUNplanner/frontend/pull/210)
- Refactors greatly to make use of Material data from IndexedDB. Also already stores recipe and building data in tables without yet using it [PR-211](https://github.com/PRUNplanner/frontend/pull/211)

# 2025-08-27

- Updates to ROI and Resource ROI Overview Help texts (by `lowstrife`)
- Implements the Production Chain Tool [#127](https://github.com/PRUNplanner/frontend/issues/127)
- Reworked cross-tab sync in favor of Web Workers, shifting load to a background thread.

# 2025-08-24

- The backend communication layer has been restructured to be key-based rather than using direct function calls, improving handling and enabling more predictable state management.
- Added functionality to persist Query, Game, and Planning data so that usersâ€™ data state is maintained across browser sessions. Additionally, static data is now broadcasted across all open tabs in the same browser.

# 2025-08-23

- Fixes an issue in HQ Upgrade Calculations were the starting level was wrongly part of the material list (by `skiedude`)

# 2025-08-22

- Fixes a bug where Planet Search material results were not sortable. This also identified a potential backend issue where searching for more than 2 materials returns results that actually don't hold the materials searched for. Currently the frontend limits to search for maximum of 2 resources until the API handling of the search query was investigated and potentially fixed.
- Selection dropdowns now close on any outside click and reset their search value on close
- Selection dropdowns now have keyboard navigation and value change
- Removes more unused naive-ui types and components from various views
- Fixes a bug on COGM calculation where the recipe runtime depended on the amount the recipe did run in a building instead of its regular runtime on current efficiency
- Adds Help text to Market Exploration (by `lowstrife`)

# 2025-08-21

- Introduce a `version.json` in Vite build, notify users on new versions to reload page

# 2025-08-19

- Replaces many `naive-ui` components with an own implementation of UI components mainly to save rendering and calculation times.
- Fixes a bug where spaces in plan names were not working [#175](https://github.com/PRUNplanner/frontend/issues/175)
- Fixes the visual bug on patching CX preferences not being displayed correctly [#135](https://github.com/PRUNplanner/frontend/issues/135)
- Handle 404 / "No results found" on Planet Search [#179](https://github.com/PRUNplanner/frontend/issues/179)
- Populates cached data from list results, e.g. all empire plans, fetching multiple planets to avoid another backend call on accessing individual data. This is experimental, but could lead to faster loading times for plans as their data and planet is already populated from accessing the empire overview.
- Capture additional events with PostHog in order to validate v2 progress and usage
